# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction---Regression-Project

This project builds a regression model that predicts individual medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle features. It helps insurance providers estimate cost more accurately.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Insurance companies often need to estimate the medical insurance costs for individuals based on factors such as age, BMI, and smoking habits. This model uses regression to predict those charges with reasonable accuracy.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `age`: Age of the individual  
- `sex`: Gender (male/female)  
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index (health risk indicator)  
- `children`: Number of children covered by insurance  
- `smoker`: Smoking status (yes/no)  
- `region`: Residential region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)  
- `charges`: Total medical insurance cost (target variable)
